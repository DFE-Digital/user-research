# DfE User Research 
# Site Currently in Development
This site documents the User Research principles, standards and guidance that we expect teams working
within the [Department for Education (DfE)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education)
to follow when designing services.

It complements the [UK Government Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) and its
[technology section](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology),
which covers service design more broadly.

It should be used in conjunction with the
[DfE Digital Technical Guidance](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk),
when building digital services.
